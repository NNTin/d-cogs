# Synced Cogs Notice

This repository mirrors two cogs that were authored elsewhere. **Please install them directly from their source repositories instead of from this mirror**.

- `assistant` — sourced from [`vertyco/vrt-cogs`](https://github.com/vertyco/vrt-cogs) (branch `main`). 
- `hotreload` — sourced from [`cswimr/SeaCogs`](https://c.csw.im/cswimr/SeaCogs) (branch `main`). 

These copies are synced for convenience and are not my creations. Please support and credit the original authors when using their cogs.

Huge thanks to [cswimr](https://c.csw.im/cswimr) and [vertyco](https://github.com/vertyco) for allowing me to mirror their work!
